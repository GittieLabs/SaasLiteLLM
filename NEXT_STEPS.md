# Next Steps for Implementation

**Current Status**: ~45% Complete
**Phase**: API Endpoints Creation

---

## ‚úÖ What's Complete

### Phase 1: Database (100%)
- 5 migration files created
- All tables designed and ready to deploy

### Phase 2: Python Models & Services (100%)
- Organizations, ModelGroups, Credits models
- Model resolver service (resolves "ResumeAgent" ‚Üí actual model)
- Credit manager service (check, deduct, allocate)
- Organizations API endpoints

---

## üîÑ Current Task: API Endpoints

I'm creating the remaining API endpoint files. Due to their size and complexity, here's the breakdown:

### Remaining API Files (3 large files)
1. **`src/api/model_groups.py`** - Full CRUD for model groups
   - Create/update/delete model groups
   - Add/remove models from groups
   - Update model priorities
   - ~200-250 lines

2. **`src/api/teams.py`** - Enhanced team management
   - Create team with org_id
   - Assign model groups to team
   - Generate virtual keys (integrate with LiteLLM)
   - Team usage queries
   - ~250-300 lines

3. **`src/api/credits.py`** - Credit management
   - Check balance
   - Add/allocate credits
   - View transactions
   - ~150-200 lines

---

## üìã After API Endpoints

### Integration Tasks
1. **Update `src/saas_api.py`**
   - Import new routers
   - Register with FastAPI app
   - Update job endpoints to use model groups
   - Update job completion to handle credits

2. **Update `src/models/job_tracking.py`**
   - Add new fields to Job model
   - Add new fields to LLMCall model
   - Update to_dict() methods

3. **Create helper scripts**
   - `scripts/seed_model_groups.py` - Create initial ResumeAgent, ParsingAgent, etc.
   - `scripts/test_railway_dev.py` - Complete test workflow
   - `scripts/run_all_migrations.sh` - Run migrations 001-006

---

## üß™ Testing Plan

Once code is complete, the testing sequence on Railway dev:

```bash
# 1. Deploy to Railway dev
railway up --environment dev

# 2. Run migrations
railway run --environment dev bash scripts/run_all_migrations.sh

# 3. Seed model groups
railway run --environment dev python scripts/seed_model_groups.py

# 4. Run test workflow
railway run --environment dev python scripts/test_railway_dev.py
```

## üéØ Decision Points

Before I continue with the remaining 3 large API files, would you like me to:

**Option A**: Continue creating all API endpoints now (3 files, ~600-750 lines total)

**Option B**: Create a working minimal version first
- Finish model_groups API
- Update saas_api.py with basic integration
- Test locally with migrations
- Then complete remaining endpoints

**Option C**: Pause and review what we have
- You run migrations locally
- Test the models and services
- Provide feedback before I continue

**Recommendation**: Option B - Get to a working minimal version faster, test it, then complete the rest. This allows for course correction if needed.

---

## üìä Estimated Time Remaining

- **API Endpoints**: 4-6 hours
- **Integration**: 2-3 hours
- **Testing Scripts**: 2 hours
- **Railway Deployment & Testing**: 3-4 hours

**Total**: 11-15 hours

## üí° What You Can Do Now

While I'm creating code, you can:

1. **Review the architecture** - Check IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
2. **Set up Railway dev environment** - Create the environment if not done
3. **Review database migrations** - Look at scripts/migrations/*.sql
4. **Plan your SaaS app integration** - How you'll call the new endpoints

## üöÄ Ready to Continue?

Let me know which option you prefer, and I'll proceed accordingly!

Quick status update:
- ‚úÖ Database: 100%
- ‚úÖ Models: 100%
- ‚úÖ Services: 100%
- ‚úÖ Organizations API: 100%
- ‚è≥ Model Groups API: 0%
- ‚è≥ Teams API: 0%
- ‚è≥ Credits API: 0%
