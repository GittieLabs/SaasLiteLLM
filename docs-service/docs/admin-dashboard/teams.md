# Teams

Learn how to create and manage teams - the primary way your clients access the SaaS LiteLLM API.

## What are Teams?

**Teams** are the core access unit in SaaS LiteLLM. Each team gets:

- ‚úÖ Unique **virtual API key** for authentication
- ‚úÖ **Credit allocation** for usage
- ‚úÖ **Model access permissions** via access groups
- ‚úÖ Independent **rate limits** (TPM/RPM)
- ‚úÖ Usage tracking and **cost monitoring**

**Key Point:** Your clients use teams to make API calls. One organization can have multiple teams (e.g., dev, staging, production).

## Creating a Team for a Client

### Quick Start

1. **Navigate to Teams** ‚Üí Click "Create Team"
2. **Fill in details:**
   - Team ID: `client-prod`
   - Organization: Select client's organization
   - Access Groups: `["gpt-models"]`
   - Credits: `1000`
3. **Click "Create"**
4. **Copy the virtual key** and share with client securely

That's it! Your client can now make API calls.

### Via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/api/teams/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "organization_id": "org_acme",
    "team_id": "acme-prod",
    "team_alias": "ACME Production",
    "access_groups": ["gpt-models"],
    "credits_allocated": 1000
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "team_id": "acme-prod",
  "organization_id": "org_acme",
  "team_alias": "ACME Production",
  "virtual_key": "sk-1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef",
  "credits_allocated": 1000,
  "credits_remaining": 1000,
  "status": "active",
  "access_groups": ["gpt-models"]
}
```

!!! warning "Save the Virtual Key"
    The virtual key is only shown once during team creation. Make sure to copy it and share it securely with your client!

## Team Properties

## Sharing Virtual Keys with Clients

### Best Practices

1. **Secure Transmission**
   - Use encrypted channels (password-protected email, secure portal)
   - Never send via plain text email or chat
   - Consider one-time secret links (e.g., onetimesecret.com)

2. **Documentation**
   - Share integration docs with the key
   - Provide example code
   - Link to your API documentation

3. **Support**
   - Provide contact for technical support
   - Set up monitoring for new teams
   - Check in after first successful API call

## Common Client Onboarding Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create organization for client
curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/api/organizations/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "organization_id": "org_newclient",
    "name": "New Client Inc"
  }'

# 2. Create production team
curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/api/teams/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "organization_id": "org_newclient",
    "team_id": "newclient-prod",
    "team_alias": "Production",
    "access_groups": ["gpt-models"],
    "credits_allocated": 1000
  }'
# Save the virtual_key from response!

# 3. (Optional) Create dev/staging team
curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/api/teams/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "organization_id": "org_newclient",
    "team_id": "newclient-dev",
    "team_alias": "Development",
    "access_groups": ["gpt-models"],
    "credits_allocated": 500
  }'

# 4. Share virtual keys with client securely
# 5. Monitor first API calls
# 6. Check in with client after 24 hours
```

## Team Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

**Team IDs:**
- Use format: `{org}-{environment}` (e.g., "acme-prod", "acme-dev")
- Keep lowercase with hyphens
- Make it descriptive

**Team Aliases:**
- Use readable names: "ACME Production", "ACME Development"
- Include environment if multiple teams

### Security

1. **Virtual Keys:**
   - Treat like passwords
   - Rotate periodically (create new team)
   - Monitor for unusual usage

2. **Access Control:**
   - Use least privilege (only needed models)
   - Separate dev and prod teams
   - Different keys per environment

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Set up alerts for high usage
   - Monitor failed requests
   - Track credit depletion rate

### Credit Management

1. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Start conservative (1000 credits)
   - Monitor usage first week
   - Adjust based on actual usage

2. **Top-ups:**
   - Set up low-credit alerts (20% remaining)
   - Automate top-ups for good customers
   - Prepaid vs. postpaid options

3. **Overage Protection:**
   - Hard limits (team suspended at 0 credits)
   - Soft limits (alert but don't suspend)
   - Grace period for good customers

## Troubleshooting

### Virtual Key Not Working

**Problem:** Client reports 401 errors

**Solutions:**
1. Verify key was copied correctly (no extra spaces)
2. Check team status is "active" (not suspended)
3. Verify `Authorization: Bearer sk-...` format
4. Check team exists in database

### Out of Credits

**Problem:** Client getting 403 "Insufficient credits"

**Solutions:**
1. Check credit balance
2. Add more credits
3. Review usage patterns
4. Consider upgrade to higher tier

### Can't Access Model

**Problem:** Client gets "Model access denied"

**Solutions:**
1. Check team's access groups
2. Verify model alias exists
3. Add required access group to team
4. Check model is active

## Next Steps

Now that you understand teams:

1. **[Allocate Credits](credits.md)** - Give teams credits to use
2. **[Configure Model Access](model-access-groups.md)** - Control which models teams can access
3. **[Share Integration Docs](../integration/overview.md)** - Help clients integrate
4. **[Monitor Usage](monitoring.md)** - Track team activity
